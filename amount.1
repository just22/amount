.Nd minimalist (semi)automatic mounter for OpenBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl r Ar path
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl e Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an
.Ox
specific, POSIX compliant shell script to manage removable devices;
it presents a list of available partitions, and (un)mount them upon
user request.
A few commands used by
.Nm
require special permissions
.Xr ( mount 8 ,
.Xr umount 8 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ...),
so it should be run as root.
.Pp
After a successful operation,
.Nm
returns the path of the mount point on stdout (for unmount
operations, the directory is removed before exiting and no longer
exists).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r Ar path
Set root mount directory to path; path must exist and have the proper
permissions (defaults to /vol).
.It Fl g Ar group
Set group ownership for mount directory.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set file mode, as in
.Xr chmod 1 ,
for mount directory.
.It Fl o Ar options
Mount options (defaults to rw,nodev,nosuid,noatime).
.It Fl e Ar device ...
The listed devices will be ignored.
.Sh CAVEATS
Changing mount directory ownership and file mode are not supported for
read-only filesystems (e.g., ISO9660 partitions).
.Pp
.Nm
emulates arrays by means of positional parameters, so it cannot manage
more than 9 partitions at a time; this limitation can be overcome using
the -e option, except when a single device by itself exceeds the
maximum number of partitions.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A simple wrapper around
.Nm
will allow the use of a filemanager, as well as endless mount/unmount
iterations:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh

keep() {
        stty raw
        dd bs=1 count=1 2> /dev/null
        stty -raw
}

clear
while : ; do
        mdir="$(/usr/bin/doas amount)"
        [ $? -ne 0 ] && keep
        clear
        [ -d "$mdir" ] && filemanager "$mdir"
done
